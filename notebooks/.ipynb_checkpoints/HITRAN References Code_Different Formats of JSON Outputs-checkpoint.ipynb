    "  3. The first option is a custom exportation of a reference using bibcodes, the html for the doi begins with https://doi.org/\n",
    "  4. Next I provided a similar option but this time with an html for the doi that begins with http://dx.doi.org/\n",
    "  5. I noticed that most references in HITRAN have three options, regular text, html or latex fields for entering information, therefore I provide options for encoding references in html and latex as well as regular text (if needed)\n",
    "  6. The second option is to encode the output in html format, this method still uses 'exportation' from ADS\n",
    "  7. The third option is to encode the output in latex format, this method still uses 'exportation' from ADS\n",
    "  8. The fourth option is to encode using requests, which pulls information using an encoded DOI\n",
    "  9. If you would like to test the json output then simply copy the json output and paste it in a text file, then change the .txt part of the file name to .html and save it. Then open the document (which should now be an html document) and click on the hyperlinks and review the output format"
